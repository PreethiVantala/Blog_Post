# **🌟 Building My First ETL Pipeline: Challenges and Learnings 🌟**

This repository contains the implementation of my first **ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline**. In this project, I built a pipeline that extracts raw data, transforms it by cleaning and structuring, and loads it into a database for analysis.

## **📖 Blog Post Overview**

In the blog post **[Building My First ETL Pipeline: Challenges and Learnings](#)** (https://medium.com/@vpr08101997/building-my-first-etl-pipeline-challenges-and-learnings-80255961c9dc), I cover:
- **What ETL is** and how it works.
- The **tools and technologies** I used, such as **Python**, **Pandas**, **SQL**, and **Apache Airflow**.
- The **challenges** I encountered (e.g., handling large datasets, data cleaning) and how I overcame them.
- The **key takeaways** and lessons learned during the process.

## **🛠️ Tech Stack**

- **🐍 Python** – For scripting and automation.
- **📊 Pandas** – For data manipulation and transformation.
- **🗄️ SQL** – For structured storage of transformed data.
- **⚙️ Apache Airflow** – For scheduling and automating the ETL pipeline.

## **⚡ Challenges & Solutions**

### 1. **📦 Handling Large Datasets Efficiently**
- **❌ Problem:** Slow processing with large datasets.
- **✅ Solution:** Used **batch processing** and optimized Pandas operations with **vectorized functions**.

### 2. **🧹 Data Cleaning Complexities**
- **❌ Problem:** Missing values, inconsistent formats, and duplicates.
- **✅ Solution:** Handled missing values with **`.fillna()`**, cleaned text data using **regular expressions**, and removed duplicates with **`.drop_duplicates()`**.

### 3. **🤖 Automating the ETL Workflow**
- **❌ Problem:** Manual execution was error-prone.
- **✅ Solution:** Automated the process with **Apache Airflow** and implemented **error logging**.

## **💡 Key Takeaways**

- **📐 Plan before coding:** Designing a flowchart helped prevent rework.
- **⚡ Efficiency matters:** Optimized transformations saved processing time.
- **🤖 Automation is key:** Tools like **Apache Airflow** eliminate manual errors.
- **🔧 Error handling is crucial:** Logging and exception handling made debugging easier.

## **🚀 Next Steps**

- Explore distributed processing with **Apache Spark**.
- Experiment with **cloud-based ETL solutions** for scalability.
- Improve **data validation techniques** before loading.
